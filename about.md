Maruader's Map by GR.

"I solemnly swear that I am up to no perfect."

In Harry Potter series, there is a [Marauder's Map][marauder's_map] whose purpose is mischief. It shows the location of any person or ghost on Hogwart’s grounds, isn’t fooled by an Animagus or an Invisibility Cloak. Users have to say 'I solemnly swear that I am up to no good' to use it.

I think there is no perfect in computer science fields. Because this fields is so wide and deep and each part is related to others. Also, existing technologies continue to change and disappear, and new ones continue to be made. So I swear that I am up to no perfect but I'm going to try to be a perfect.

Maruader's Map by GR shows the things I learned and done and the trial-and-errors I went trough while developing. There must be mistakes in some posts. Please tell me about your comments and point out my mistakes. Then I'll gladly accept it! :)
